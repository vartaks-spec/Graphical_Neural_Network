	  Devices collected on March 10th, 2005 in the afternoon.

Participants: 
50 students, attending the student workshop.

Collected datas: 
- 2 iMotes were lost, and 7 did not deliver useful data, as a consequence
of accidental hardware reset. Contacts with any of these were discarded
from the traces of other iMotes to avoid any consequence on the
experimental results.

- The first six hours were discarded, as people were attending the same workshop during the first afternoon. 

- Details of ID number:
	ID 1-41 are corresponding to iMotes (Class 1)
	ID 42-274 corresponds to external devices (Class 2)
